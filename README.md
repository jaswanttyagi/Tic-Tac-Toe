🎮 Project Update: Tic Tac Toe Game using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript!

I’m excited to share my latest mini-project — a fully functional Tic Tac Toe game built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This project was a fun way to strengthen my understanding of DOM manipulation, event handling, and game logic implementation in JavaScript.

💡 About the Project:
The game allows two players to take turns marking X and O on a 3×3 grid. It automatically detects winning conditions, handles draw scenarios, and displays the game result dynamically. I also added a “New Game” button to reset the board and start again without refreshing the page.

💻 Tech Stack Used:

HTML – for structuring the board and buttons.

CSS – for styling the layout with responsive design, hover effects, and clean UI.

JavaScript – for handling user input, checking winning combinations, and controlling game flow.

⚙ Key Learnings:

Gained a deeper understanding of how to manipulate DOM elements using querySelector and querySelectorAll.

Learned to manage state and alternate player turns efficiently.

Implemented logic to determine winning patterns and detect a draw.

Improved my CSS skills by designing a simple yet engaging game interface.

🚀 Future Enhancements:
I plan to add features like score tracking, AI opponent mode, and sound effects to make the game more interactive and challenging.

This project was a great step in applying my JavaScript knowledge to a real interactive application. Each function I wrote helped me understand how logic and UI connect to create a complete user experience.

🔗 I’d love your feedback or suggestions to make it even better!
